VR Streaming Proxy for a popular service

If you found this project, you're clearly looking for a solution for continued DeoVR Streaming on the Quest1 Device.

My goal, should this project be successful, is to develop an HTTP Proxy that runs on a personal device such as a Home-Theatre Server, NAS, or maybe even a Raspberry-Pi, where this Proxy enough internal logic to fix whatever the hell broke with the upstream service.

### Why?
In mid-September, 2024, this popular streaming service simply threw their hands up in the air and said Quest1 deprecated and broken. (Nice of them to do that just days before Quest3 announced rolling out, huh?)

### First Steps
Try to capture traffic, ideally with an injected SSL/TLS certificate to the VR Headset for the proxy service so we can peek into the internal traffic. This is a non-starter if we can't even get past this step. This place-holder project won't proceed unless I can crack that nut.

Check back soon to observe the progress; or drop comments or notes in other areas of this GH Project where appropriate to egg this on or offer help/suggestions.
